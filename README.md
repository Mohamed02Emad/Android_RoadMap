Android :is a [mobile operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system) **based on a modified version of the** [**Linux kernel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel 'Linux kernel') and other [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software 'Open-source software') software, designed primarily for [**touchscreen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen 'Touchscreen') mobile devices such as [**smartphones**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone 'Smartphone') and [**tablets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer 'Tablet computer')**.**

## Notes:

- We recommend having a brief experience in computer science and competetive programming before you begin.

## This roadmap would consist of 5 levels:

| üìùLevel                  | üîéContent                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Kotlin**](#kotlin)  | Learn Kotlin language to be prepared for Android fields.               |
|  [**Android Basics**](#android-basics) | Learn the basics of Android and develop your first app.   |
| [**Intermediate**](#intermediate)  | develop more advaned apps and deal with apis.      |
| [**Advanced**](#advanced)  | Choose what to learn next.            |
| [**Jave (Optional)**](#java)  | Learn the Java programming language to prepare for interviews and gain a deeper understanding of what you already know. |

# Kotlin:

<p >
  <img src="https://images.prismic.io/qovery/c952e642-7c8c-4e2f-854e-b14a14868b3e_kotlin.png?ixlib=gatsbyFP&auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&q=50" alt="Kotlin logo" height="200" />
</p>


**Kotlin** is a modern, statically-typed programming language known for its conciseness and safety features. It's widely used for Android app development and offers seamless interoperability with Java.

## Kotlin Programming Language Resources:

---

1. **BK Programming**:

- [Full Kotlin cource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf25hIH9M9M&list=PLEPx7DrqAqKB01JqOEbJBBfWdPrqmps7M)

2. **If you came from java**:
- [Kotlin for Java developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers/home/week/1)

- We recommend to read at least first 3 chapters of [CleanCode](https://thixalongmy.haugiang.gov.vn/media/1175/clean_code.pdf):

# Android Basics:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607252650355-f7fd0460ccdb?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8YW5kcm9pZHxlbnwwfHwwfHx8MA%3D%3D&w=1000&q=80" alt="Android Basics" height="400" />
</p>


In this level we will develop our first app, learn basics of android design with xml,use RecyclerViews, sharedPreferences,  navigate between multiple screens and more important android basic topics.

we will also learn about [MVVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/) and [App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) by the end of this level
## Resources:

 Part one of Udacity Nano degree

 Part two (except for first and third lessons)
- [Android Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-interface--ud834)    `recommended`

or you can look for same topics of the nano degree on this chanel

- [Phillip Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner)


`Try to make Todo App with what you learned for example or any task for improving your skill`

---

# Intermediate:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/How_to_Become_an_Android_Developer.jpg" alt="Android Basics" height="400" />
</p>


First we will learn about Room and Retrofit (the two lessons we skipped before at part two):
- [Android Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-interface--ud834)

Then we will learn about Coroutines, Services, BroadCastReceivers, PushNotifications, FireBase, contentProviders

We might also deal with local PHP servers to have better experience with apis (we wont create them we will just use them )


## Resources:

We will depend on Android Developers Documentations 

- [Android Docs](https://developer.android.com/docs)

## Firebase

**Firebase** is a platform developed by Google for creating [**mobile**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_application 'Mobile phone application') and [**web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application 'Web application') applications.


## Resources:

- [Coding with flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVokoelQ1RI&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuBf5KH4XXOthtgo6E4Epjl8)

or

- [FireBase Auth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu3bHQWD6A0&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCQGK2N-Sl4jKlX9M3GtPUJd&pp=iAQB)

- [FireBase FireStore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEl--hArDGE&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCTJLKhPGqgLFTKDsHfF9Arv&pp=iAQB)

- [FireBase Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kaju915GDTU&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCTzKNg1K-BZfamxXxOC2IeB&pp=iAQB)

- [Push notifications with Firebase](https://youtu.be/HoFWPPv1ih8?si=gk4ziXWQoOd-nqw1)


`I highly recommend creating your own chat app using Firebase at this stage. While it may take some time, it will be a valuable investment.`



# Advanced:

<p align="center">

</p>


Now you are ready to choose what to learn next and start your own career as an Android developer. However, we will recommend some steps for you:

How ever we will recommend some steps for you 

- Until now, you have been developing with XML. You should start learning Compose.

- You should also learn Java for future interviews and to gain a deeper understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and what you have learned until now.

- You can explore the Google Maps API.

- Canvas and Custom Views.

`Remember, 'If you don't motivate yourself, no one will.'`

# Java:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://dev.java/assets/images/java-logo-vert-blk.png" alt="Java" height="400" />
</p>

# You can start this level at any time

**Java** is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language 'High-level programming language'), [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming 'Class-based programming'), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming 'Object-oriented programming') [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language 'Programming language') that is designed to have as few implementation [dependencies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_(computer_science)> 'Dependency (computer science)') as possible. It is a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language 'General-purpose language') programming language intended to let [application developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_developer) _write once._
